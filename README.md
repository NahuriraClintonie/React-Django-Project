## Introduction

This project is a web application that integrates a React frontend with a Django backend. It aims to provide a seamless user experience by utilizing the capabilities of both frameworks, allowing for efficient data handling and dynamic user interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
    - React (with TypeScript)
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Axios (for API requests)

- **Backend:**
    - Django (with Django REST Framework)
    - PostgreSQL (for database management)

- **Development Tools:**
    - Git (for version control)
    - npm (for package management)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (with npm)
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript 

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NahuriraClintonie/React-Django-Project.git
cd React-Django-Project

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:
    cd backend

Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your PostgreSQL database and update your settings.py with the database configurations.

Run the migrations:
    python manage.py migrate

Start the Django server:
    python manage.py runserver

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
    cd frontend

Install the required npm packages:
    npm install

Start the React application:
    npm start
